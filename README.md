- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidthebold. 
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things. Meditation, startups, weight lifting, cold exposure, making ceviche, programming, growth hacking and combat sports.
- 🌱 Within the context of GitHub, I'm currently learning Python, after which I'll work on React. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything where I could be useful - my primary background is in B2B sales so probably more of a value add on that front. 
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter @dpcooper or email me at davidhasheart@gmail.com.
